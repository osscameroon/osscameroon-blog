Hi mates, Hope you doing good.

As you already know, you can apply through many ways.

Here, I'm sharing what I used to do. This method is useful because **you speak directly with an employee who may give you more information about the role, the relocation package and other useful information. Based on my experience, it works and is really fast.**

**Furthermore, if you need more information, you can speak directly with the employee instead of sending email and wait sometimes for a long time before getting a reply or no reply at all.** 

This approach works like a charm. How does it work ? Search on LinkedIn: **"{company.name} {country.name} Talent " and "{company.name} {country.name} Recruiter ".** It is a keywords search that will show you employees working in the Human Resources department (HR). HR is often called Talent Acquisition Specialist or Recruiter. This is why I am using the words Talent and Recruiter in my search. It depends on what you are looking for. **Here, I'm a looking for a Recruiter / Talent Acquisition Specialist so choose your keywords wisely.**

**My advice, send at least 10 PERSONALIZED INVITATIONS not simple ones per search on LinkedIn. Not everyone will accept, but the most important thing is that at least one person from the target company will accept. Then, you will move forward quickly with your job search.** 

This is a tip that I always use on LinkedIn.

Have a nice job application journey ðŸ™‚ !
