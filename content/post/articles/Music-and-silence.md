Listen to music while coding or enter the zone (state of concentration created by silence).
Opinions are divided on the subject, on the one hand we have coders who like to boost their concentration and productivity by listening to music and those who only want "silence"üëÑ, in this article we will explore these two opinions.

# Code with music
Friedrich Nietzsche said <<*Without music life would be a mistake.*>>

The brain has to make efforts to analyze and process information based on abstract and logical reasoning during coding, several studies such as [University of Birmingham research](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003687072901019), [PNAS research](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/3310), [Stanford University School of Medicine research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627307005004) show that music is effective in improving focus and productivity.

### Concentration and productivity
The benefits of music on our brain are numerous we can mention:
###### Boost motivation

I'm sure you know this good old mister "bug" that everyone wants to embrace he only brings us happiness when coding üêõ, more seriously as a developer, we often if not always encounter bugs in our code which can sometimes push us to abandon our code, because we cannot find the error, or because we consider that we have sought too much for the solution, in short it demotivates us but thanks to the studies cited above we can say that to listen a music that we like can help to take a step back, to reconsider the problem from another angle because the music will make us happy, more relaxed and therefore open to new possibilities to kill or permanently solve this dear mister bug üòä.

###### Boost creativity

Creativity can be boosted by music, according to a [study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182210) by researchers at Radboud University (Netherlands) and Sydney University of Technology (Australia) the researchers found that listening to happy music, which they define as music with positive, awakening values (a relative positivity because coders who love devil metal are also happy) facilitates more inspiring creative thinking than silence.

I'm a supporter of this opinion, so here are some nuggets(without wanting to advertise) I use when I meet mister bug:

# Code with silence

Lao Tzu said <<*Silence is a source of Great Strength*>>

Not everyone uses music to cope with the different difficulties that one can encounter while coding so there are those who are for silence (the zone), a 2013 [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259110014_Is_silence_golden_Effects_of_auditory_stimuli_and_their_absence_on_adult_hippocampal_neurogenesis) found that two hours of silence could create new cells in the hippocampus region, a brain area linked to learning, remembering, and emotions.According to a 2006 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1860846/), two minutes of silence relieves tension in the body and brain and is more relaxing than listening to music.  
Silence also has its advantages:

###### Boost creativity
When you allow thoughts to go where they want, inspiration can flow. Solutions to current or long standing problems may suddenly appear to you, or a workaround or innovative approach may seem more achievable. Ideas for going in a different direction might merge together, help build momentum and enthusiasm to turn them into other potential avenues to pursue.Follow this [link](https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-hidden-benefits-of-silence#1) to read the article.  

###### Deal with your emotions
When you practice solitude and silence, you allow your brain to process your emotions, rather than suppressing them and staying on autopilot. You may experience uncomfortable emotions during this process, but the sooner you recognize and process your feelings, the sooner you can move forward in health and freedom.

In the end, I think that to improve creativity, concentration when coding, it really depends on everyone's desires and affinities, whether with music or with silence (the zone)üî•.
