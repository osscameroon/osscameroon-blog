Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs, designing, constructing, and testing end-user applications that will satisfy those needs through the use of software programming languages. It is the application of engineering principles to software development.

To be an Application Developer, good news there is not just one path, in this article we will talk about the different paths you have to take to become a software developer and the advantages and disadvantages of certain paths. But in the end it's up to you to decide which path is best for you.

## Get an university Degree

Going to college to graduate is the traditional path people take to become a developer.
This path involves obtaining an associate's degree or a minimum bachelor's degree in computer science, computer programming, or a related field. But believe it or not, going to college to be a software developer has its pros and cons.

##### #Pros:

it opens doors, indeed people with a degree in Computer science are more easily accepted by the technology industry, because the recruiter will look at the school where you did your classes and judge you according to the renowned of this school in terms of the courses offered by the school that graduated you.

When you go to university to get a degree, you have several teachers who are much more present and attentive to your concerns, because you have a long period of time to perfect your education as a software developer.

##### #Cons:

Going to university takes a long time. Usually it takes at least three years to get a degree in computer science, which is too long for some people (like those who are in professional retraining or who are not interested in university courses because of their duration).

Going to university is also very expensive. In Cameroon it is sometimes necessary to count at least 350,000 or 450,000 XAF just for a single year of university study in the Computer Science sector.

The emphasis is much more on the theoretical aspect of the courses which sometimes displeases more than one.

Do not forget one thing, the computer science degree is only a piece of paper, when you hire a developer, you hire him not for his beautiful eyes, but more for his skills, basically for what he is able to do.

# Choose your BootCamp :

Coding bootcamps are intensive software development programs. They first appeared in 2011 (Wikipedia) .They are intensive, accelerated learning programs that teach beginners digital skills like Full-Stack Web Development, Data Science, Digital Marketing, UX / UI Design and more.Through project-based learning, coding bootcamps get students job-ready for a career in tech in generally about 12 weeks.At the end of the BootCamp, the BootCampers leave with a portfolio, an online presence, interview skills and more.

##### #Pros:

Provides skills in demand by businesses.

Allows you to be hired quickly (it depends on your level of practice)

BootCamps are much more affordable than universities.

The duration of the training is much shorter.

##### #Cons:

Being trained for just 12 weeks in Software Development can be difficult due to the short duration of training, and for this reason it is not easy for everyone to adapt to it.

Usually in bootcamps 90% of learning is done hands-on, but some people feel that the main emphasis should be on concept theory as they find it much more interesting and important than practice.

# Be a full Sel-Taught developer:

{{<figure src="/Become-A-Software-Developer/self-taught-developer.jpg"  alt="self-taught-developer">}}

A self-taught developer doesn't wait for someone to take initiative on their behalf and prepare to excel in programming skills of any kind. When you learn to code, you learn at your own pace using free or paid online / offline resources.

##### #Pros:

Full developer Self-Taught is much more free we all agree on this, he has no teachers on his back, or an instructor everything happens between him, his computer and obviously the internet (it is better)
His study program, his projects, his ideas are all from A to Z managed by him, he is taken into consideration much more when he has assimilated the different concepts and principles of software development.

##### #Cons:

The self-taught developer is taken much less seriously because the recruiter does not have confidence in his background, for this reason a self-taught developer must have a concrete portfollio, be positive, have self-confidence, know how to express his programming skills , his communication skills, he must be persevering.

According to FreeCodeCamp.org, there are five phases you need to go through when you're a self-taught programmer:

###### Pick a niche.
###### Find structured learning resources for your niche.
###### Learn.
###### Build something, anything!
###### Network.
