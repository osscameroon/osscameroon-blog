Hello, I'm Patricia Tchuegno, Sofware developper. I'm passionate about making beautiful websites. That's why I usually work on the front end side. But I also like writing algorithms and solving problems. So I can work on the back end side also. I have skills in digital marketing and want to learn more about Data Science. I used to code with AngularJs, ReactJs, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Laravel, etc.
I really want to perform my skills in programming to add my value and have more experience.
