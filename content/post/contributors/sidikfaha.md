Hello everyone, I am **Aboubakar Sidik FAHA NEMBOT**, commonly known as **Joe** and I am a software engineer. I am passionate about IT in general and development in particular. I already have 4 years of experience in web development. I recently learned Flutter and it has immediately become my preferred language for mobile development. The languages I know at the moment are: Js, Python, Java, C # ...

I also create awesome stuff with Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, Premiere, and After Effects. Yes you got it, I am also a designer !!

I know it's a big mess, but when I like something, I have no limits ...
