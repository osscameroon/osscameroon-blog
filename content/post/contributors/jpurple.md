Hi there, I'm Ngnepedoh Irving Craig (yh but call me purple/jpurple), young aspiring developer. I am an IT enthusiast and am fascinated by Artificial Intelligence. I am familiar with Java, Python and C. Currently working as an android app developer. I look forward to working with you all and am excited about what I will learn here.
