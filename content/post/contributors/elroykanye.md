Hi, I'm Elroy Kanye. I'm a software engineering student at the University of Bamenda. 
I'm currently working on building skill sets for systems programming and development. 
My interests include devops, machine learning, and blockchain. Out of code, I love to read, and I love photography
Stay blessed.
