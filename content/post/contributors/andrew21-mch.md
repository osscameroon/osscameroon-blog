Hi! I'm Andrew Tatah(Andy in shortðŸ˜‰!). I'm a computer engineering student. I am so passionate about Software developement, Data Sciece, System Engineering, Digital Electronics and Networking, guess i'm a jack!. I code in 'old php' as people say and also another jack when it comes to programming languages(which doesnt matter tho).
fun fact?: i crashed my linux system over 6 times in 6 weeks while trying to grasp the concepts of shell scriptingðŸ˜….
