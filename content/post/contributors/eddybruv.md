Hello, I'm Edwin Ajong, you can call me Eddy👀. I'm a level 300 student in UB(means its my 2nd year in university)😅, reading computer engineering(Faculty of Engineering and Technology).

I started my journey in this tech field just about a year ago when I got into the university. So far, the journey has been an exciting one, not an easy one tho😐, but I guess we all have to be consistent to make it😁.

The skills in my arsenal are: C, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap,  JavaScript, ReactJS, Express, Node, MongoDB.

Together with the above, I'm currently learning python, java(for school purposes), and NextJS.

I'm happy to belong to this tech community✊.

Nice to meet you💖.
