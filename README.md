## Prerequisites

The blog is powered by the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website generator, with the [Chunky Poster](https://github.com/puresyntax71/hugo-theme-chunky-poster) theme and might require you to have a set of tools installed on your local machine such as :

* The **Hugo** cli tool, follow [these steps](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing) to install **Hugo**
* And a Markdown text editor (We recommend [**Typora**](https://typora.io/))

Learn more about **Hugo** [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3&ab_channel=MikeDane) or read the [documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
